#  Provider - Flutter Advanced State Management 



##  What is Flutter Provider ?

* In Flutter State Management of variables is difficult, so people started using BLoC .

But BLoC is not easy to understand and there is a lot of Boilerplate code.

So Flutter introduces a new way to Manage State using Providers.



## How Provider Works?

* So there are basically three things:

1. ChangeNotifierProvider Widget

2. Model Class with ChangeNotifier

3.  The Wigdets(in seperate class) for which the state to be managed

* So the widgets for which the state to be managed are wrapped inside the ChangeNotifierProvider Widget

* then the Model class is provided for the ChangeNotifierProvider

* So whenever there is a state change in model class, it will send notification to each widget(only changed ones)

* And the widgets then rebuild their ui



##  What's this Provider Demo App do?

* So it is implementation of flutter Providers State Management Concept.

* The App on Start fetches data from a api

And shows image and title from that data.

* By clicking that fab(refresh) button it fetches new data from the same api with a random generated id...
